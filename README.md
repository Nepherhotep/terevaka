Terevaka
========

Application framework for moai.

Terevaka framework aims to solve just several problems:

1. Screen density fragmentation
2. Screen size fragmentation
3. GUI layout builder

Since it is a framework, it will implement convenient application structure.

Also you could notice that many things implemented in a way you already saw in Android native applications. Really, why not? :)
